# Subject Line Formulas — 50+ Proven Formulas

## The Only Job of a Subject Line

Get the email opened. That's it. A subject line is not a summary,
not a headline, not a description. It is a door. Your only job is
to make someone curious enough to open it.

---

## The 4 Triggers That Get Emails Opened

Every subject line that works does at least one of these:

| Trigger | What It Does | Best For |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Curiosity** | Creates an open loop the brain wants to close | Cold, nurture |
| **Self-interest** | Answers "what's in it for me?" instantly | Sales, onboarding |
| **Urgency** | Creates fear of missing out or losing something | Promotions, deadlines |
| **Personalization** | Makes it feel written specifically for them | Cold, reengagement |

---

## Category 1 — Curiosity (Opens Without Giving It Away)

These subject lines create an open loop. The brain hates unfinished
questions and will open the email to close it.

| Formula | Example |
|---------|---------|
| `quick question` | quick question |
| `something I found` | something I found on your site |
| `had an idea for [company]` | had an idea for Notion |
| `okay to send something over?` | okay to send something over? |
| `made this for you` | made this for you, Sarah |
| `[number] things I noticed` | 3 things I noticed about your onboarding |
| `weird question` | weird question |
| `nobody talks about this` | nobody talks about this in SaaS |
| `unpopular opinion about [topic]` | unpopular opinion about cold email |
| `this might be obvious but...` | this might be obvious but... |
| `not sure if you saw this` | not sure if you saw this |
| `is this still a problem for you?` | is this still a problem for you? |
| `thought about you when I saw this` | thought about you when I saw this |

✅ BEST USED FOR: Cold outreach, re-engagement, newsletter
❌ AVOID FOR: Transactional emails (needs clarity, not curiosity)

---

## Category 2 — Personalization (Feels Like It's Just For Them)

These make the reader feel the email was written specifically for
them — because it was. The more specific, the better.

| Formula | Example |
|---------|---------|
| `[first name], [observation]` | Sarah, saw your post about churn |
| `re: [their recent action]` | re: your ProductHunt launch |
| `congrats on [milestone]` | congrats on the Series A |
| `saw you're hiring [role]` | saw you're hiring a Head of Growth |
| `[mutual name] suggested I reach out` | David suggested I reach out |
| `[company]'s [specific thing]` | Notion's onboarding flow |
| `your [specific page/feature/post]` | your pricing page |
| `switching from [competitor]?` | switching from HubSpot? |
| `noticed [specific thing about them]` | noticed you just launched in Europe |
| `[company] + [your company]` | Acme + Stripe — worth a chat? |
| `following up on [specific thing]` | following up on your ProductHunt post |

✅ BEST USED FOR: Cold outreach, account-based sales
❌ AVOID: Faking personalization (e.g. wrong company name — destroys trust)

---

## Category 3 — Self-Interest (Clear Benefit Upfront)

These answer "what's in it for me?" before the email is even opened.
Best for audiences who already know they have a problem.

| Formula | Example |
|---------|---------|
| `how to [outcome] in [timeframe]` | how to close 30% more leads in 2 weeks |
| `[X]% of [audience] do this wrong` | 73% of SaaS founders do this wrong |
| `the [adjective] way to [task]` | the fastest way to write cold emails |
| `[result] without [pain]` | more signups without more ad spend |
| `stop [painful thing]` | stop losing leads to slow follow-up |
| `[number] [things] that [outcome]` | 5 emails that got us to $1M ARR |
| `how [similar company] got [result]` | how Linear got 50K users without ads |
| `[X] minutes to [outcome]` | 15 minutes to a better onboarding flow |
| `the [thing] you're missing` | the onboarding step you're missing |
| `why your [thing] isn't working` | why your cold emails aren't working |
| `fix your [thing] in [timeframe]` | fix your churn in 30 days |
| `get [outcome] by [timeframe]` | get your first 100 users by Friday |

✅ BEST USED FOR: Newsletter, nurture sequences, sales emails
❌ AVOID: Overpromising — if the email doesn't deliver, trust is gone

---

## Category 4 — Urgency & Scarcity (Time-Sensitive)

These create fear of missing something. Only use when the urgency
is REAL — fake urgency is noticed and destroys credibility fast.

| Formula | Example |
|---------|---------|
| `last chance to [action]` | last chance to lock in beta pricing |
| `closing [thing] on [specific day]` | closing early access on Friday |
| `[X] spots left` | 3 spots left for this month |
| `this expires [timeframe]` | this expires tonight at midnight |
| `don't miss [thing]` | don't miss the live walkthrough |
| `your [X] is about to expire` | your free trial expires in 3 days |
| `we're shutting down [feature]` | we're removing the free plan on March 1 |
| `[date] deadline` | March 31 deadline — founding member pricing |
| `only until [day]` | only available until Sunday |
| `[number] hours left` | 24 hours left to register |
| `going up [day]` | price goes up Monday |

✅ BEST USED FOR: Promotions, trial expiry, event invites, pricing changes
❌ AVOID: Using urgency more than once per month — loses impact fast

---

## Category 5 — Social Proof (Others Are Doing It)

Humans follow other humans. These subject lines use the behavior
of others to create credibility and trust before the email is read.

| Formula | Example |
|---------|---------|
| `how [company] [result]` | how Figma got to 4M users |
| `[X] companies are doing this` | 2,000 startups switched last month |
| `why [audience] choose [product]` | why YC founders choose Brex |
| `what [big name] uses for [task]` | what Stripe uses for onboarding |
| `[X] people can't be wrong` | 10,000 developers can't be wrong |
| `trusted by [specific names]` | trusted by Stripe, Vercel, and Linear |
| `what [big name] taught us` | what Airbnb taught us about copy |
| `used by [X]% of [audience]` | used by 40% of YC W24 companies |
| `[customer name]'s story` | how Loom went from 0 to 14M users |
| `join [X] [audience]` | join 8,000 founders who already use this |

✅ BEST USED FOR: Cold outreach, launch emails, nurture sequences
❌ AVOID: Name-dropping companies that haven't given permission

---

## Category 6 — Question (Brain Engagement)

Questions force the brain to search for an answer. The only way to
find it is to open the email.

| Formula | Example |
|---------|---------|
| `are you still [pain]?` | are you still manually writing reports? |
| `what would you do if [scenario]?` | what would you do if signups doubled? |
| `is [assumption] true for you?` | is email still your top channel? |
| `why does [frustrating thing] happen?` | why does onboarding drop off at step 3? |
| `have you tried [thing]?` | have you tried cold email sequences? |
| `what's stopping you from [goal]?` | what's stopping you from launching? |
| `how long does [task] take you?` | how long does your weekly report take? |
| `do you know your [metric]?` | do you know your activation rate? |
| `are you making this mistake?` | are you making this pricing mistake? |
| `which [thing] is right for you?` | which pricing model is right for you? |

✅ BEST USED FOR: Nurture, onboarding, re-engagement, cold email
❌ AVOID: Questions that can be answered with "no" and deleted

---

## Category 7 — Re-engagement & Win-back

These work because they're unexpected — honest, low-pressure, human.
Most re-engagement emails are ignored because they're too pushy.
These stand out by doing the opposite.

| Formula | Example |
|---------|---------|
| `we miss you, [name]` | we miss you, John |
| `closing your file` | closing your file |
| `everything okay?` | everything okay? |
| `still interested in [thing]?` | still interested in {{product}}? |
| `a lot has changed since you left` | a lot has changed since you left |
| `before you go...` | before you go, see what's new |
| `one last thing` | one last thing |
| `you left something behind` | you left something behind |
| `we changed [thing] you didn't like` | we changed the pricing you didn't like |
| `[name], it's been [timeframe]` | Sarah, it's been 3 months |
| `was it something we said?` | was it something we said? |
| `come back — things are different` | come back — things are different |

✅ BEST USED FOR: Churned users, cold leads gone quiet, inactive subscribers
❌ AVOID: Using "closing your file" more than once — it loses the effect

---

## Category 8 — Transactional (High Open Rate by Default)

Transactional emails have the highest open rates of any email type
(60–80%) because people expect them. The job here is clarity, not cleverness.

| Formula | Example |
|---------|---------|
| `your [thing] is ready` | your report is ready |
| `receipt for [product/amount]` | receipt for Pro Plan — $49 |
| `[name], your account was updated` | John, your account was updated |
| `action required: [task]` | action required: confirm your email |
| `important update about [thing]` | important update about your subscription |
| `your [X] expires in [time]` | your trial expires in 3 days |
| `[thing] was successful` | your payment was successful |
| `[thing] failed — action needed` | your payment failed — action needed |
| `new login to your account` | new login to your account from Delhi |
| `[name] invited you to [thing]` | Alex invited you to Acme workspace |
| `your [thing] has been [action]` | your request has been approved |

✅ BEST USED FOR: Receipts, confirmations, alerts, account updates
❌ AVOID: Being clever or mysterious — clarity is the only goal here

---

## Subject Line Length Guide

| Device | Visible Characters | Recommendation |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| Mobile (most opens) | 30–40 chars | Keep it under 40 |
| Desktop Gmail | 60–70 chars | Under 60 is safe |
| Apple Watch | 15 chars | First 15 must hook |
| Ideal target | 6–10 words | Short wins on all devices |

---

## Subject Line Mistakes to Avoid

| ❌ Bad Pattern | Why It Fails | ✅ Fix |
|---------------|-------------|--------|
| "Following up again" | Signals desperation | "one more thought" |
| "Just checking in" | Zero value signal | "quick question about {{pain}}" |
| "I wanted to reach out" | Filler, weak | Delete — start with the point |
| "Hope this finds you well" | Robot talk | Start with something specific |
| "Exciting news!" | Overused, vague | Tell them the actual news |
| "URGENT: Act Now!!!" | Spam trigger | Use real context for urgency |
| FWD: RE: RE: RE: | Clickbait — destroys trust | Honest curiosity instead |
| Emoji in every subject | Desensitizes quickly | Reserve for 1-2 key sends/year |
| "Free" at start of line | Top spam trigger word | Move it mid-sentence |
| "[First name] !!!" | Fake enthusiasm | Let the content earn excitement |

## The 10-Second Subject Line Test

Before sending, ask these questions:

```
1. Would I open this if a stranger sent it?
2. Is it under 40 characters for mobile?
3. Does it avoid all spam trigger words?
4. Does it match the tone of the email body?
5. Does it make a promise the email actually delivers?
6. Is it honest — not clickbait?
7. Would it stand out in a crowded inbox?
8. Have I used this formula recently with this list?
9. Does it trigger at least one of the 4 open triggers?
10. Could it be shorter?
```

If you answer "no" or "unsure" to any of these — rewrite it.

## A/B Testing Subject Lines

Always test subject lines before rolling out to your full list.

**Minimum list size to test:** 1,000 subscribers
**Test split:** 50/50 to a small segment (20% of list)
**Winner metric:** Open rate after 4 hours
**Send winner to:** Remaining 80% of list

**What to test (in order of impact):**
1. Curiosity vs. self-interest framing
2. With vs. without personalization (`[name]`)
3. Question vs. statement
4. Short (under 5 words) vs. medium (6–10 words)
5. Lowercase vs. sentence case
6. With emoji vs. without emoji
