# Email Copywriting Rules — Deep Framework

---

## Part 1 — The Psychology Behind Email

### Why People Open Emails
There are only 3 reasons someone opens an email:
1. **They know and trust the sender** — relationship beats everything
2. **The subject line triggers curiosity or self-interest** — "what's in it for me?"
3. **It feels urgent or timely** — fear of missing something relevant

If your open rates are low, the problem is always one of these three — usually #2.

### Why People Read Emails
An email is read line by line. Every sentence has ONE job: **make the reader read the next sentence.** The moment a sentence fails that job, the email is closed.

### Why People Act on Emails
People act when:
- The benefit is clear and specific
- The risk feels low
- The CTA is obvious and singular
- They feel the email was written for them personally

## Part 2 — The 8 Core Copywriting Principles

### Principle 1: One Email = One Idea
Every email should do exactly one thing. If you ask for a demo, a referral, and a review in the same email — you'll get none of them.

```
❌ "Check out our new feature, and also here's a case study,
    and we'd love a review, and can you refer a friend?"

✅ "We just launched [feature]. Here's what it does for you."
```

---

### Principle 2: The "So What?" Test
After every sentence, ask "so what?" If you can't answer it immediately, cut the sentence.

```
❌ "We use advanced machine learning algorithms to process your data."
    So what? → Fails. Nobody cares about the method.

✅ "Your reports are ready in 30 seconds instead of 3 hours."
    So what? → "That saves me 2.5 hours a week." ✅ Passes.
```

---

### Principle 3: Specificity Is Credibility
Vague claims feel like lies. Specific claims feel like proof.

```
❌ "Saves you a ton of time"        → sounds made up
❌ "Dramatically increases revenue" → meaningless
❌ "Used by top companies"          → who?

✅ "Saves you 4.3 hours per week"   → believable because it's odd
✅ "Increased MRR by 23% in 6 weeks" → specific = credible
✅ "Used by Stripe, Linear, and Vercel" → named = trustworthy
```

Note: Oddly specific numbers (4.3, 23%, 6 weeks) are MORE believable than round numbers (5 hours, 25%, 2 months).

---

### Principle 4: Write to One Person
Never write "to your team" or "for companies like yours." Picture one real person. Give them a name. Write only to that person.

```
❌ "For teams who want to improve their workflow..."
✅ "If you're the person who ends up manually exporting those
    spreadsheets every Monday morning — this is for you."
```

---

### Principle 5: Lead With Pain, Not Product
Nobody wakes up excited to hear about your product. They wake up thinking about their problems.

```
WRONG ORDER:
"Introducing [product] — the AI-powered tool that [feature list]."

RIGHT ORDER:
"Every Monday you spend 3 hours pulling reports that should take 10 minutes.
[Product] does it automatically while you sleep."
```

The formula: **Pain → Agitate → Solution (PAS)**
1. Name the pain they already feel
2. Twist the knife — make it feel worse / more urgent
3. Present your product as the specific relief

---

### Principle 6: The First Line Is Everything
The first line of your email body is previewed in every inbox. It's your second subject line. Most people write throwaway openers.

```
❌ "I hope this email finds you well."       → deleted
❌ "I wanted to reach out because..."        → deleted
❌ "My name is X and I work at Y..."         → deleted

✅ "You lost 3 leads this week to slow follow-up."
✅ "Most founders I talk to are still doing this manually."
✅ "Your competitor just launched something you should know about."
```

### Principle 7: Short = More Read
Average email reading time is 11 seconds. Fight for every second.

| Email Type | Ideal Word Count |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Cold outreach | 50–100 words |
| Sales follow-up | 50–75 words |
| Onboarding (Day 1) | 75–100 words |
| Newsletter | 200–400 words |
| Investor update | 300–500 words |
| Transactional | Under 50 words |

If your email is longer, ask: "Does every sentence earn its place?"
If the answer is no — cut it.

---

### Principle 8: One CTA, Maximum Friction Removed
Every CTA should:
- Be a single action (not two options)
- Use an active verb ("Book", "Start", "See", "Get")
- Remove every possible friction ("takes 60 seconds", "no credit card")
- Appear only once (multiple links split attention)

```
❌ "Click here to learn more or schedule a call or sign up for free."
   (3 CTAs = decision paralysis = no action)

✅ "See it in action → {{link}}"
✅ "Start free — no credit card needed"
✅ "Book a 15-min call (I'll do all the talking)"
```

## Part 3 — Email Structure Formulas

### Formula 1: PAS (Pain → Agitate → Solution)
Best for: Cold email, re-engagement, sales

```
[Pain]    — Name the specific problem they have right now
[Agitate] — Make it feel more urgent / expensive / frustrating
[Solution] — Introduce your product as the exact relief
[CTA]     — One specific next step
```

Example:
```
Writing cold emails takes 2 hours a day for most SDRs.
Those 2 hours compound — that's 40 hours a month not selling.
[Product] writes personalized cold emails in 30 seconds per lead.
Want to see it work on your actual prospect list?
```

---

### Formula 2: AIDA (Attention → Interest → Desire → Action)
Best for: Launch emails, newsletters, promotional emails

```
[Attention] — Hook with a bold statement, stat, or question
[Interest]  — Explain why it matters to them specifically
[Desire]    — Build want through benefits, proof, or story
[Action]    — Single clear CTA
```

---

### Formula 3: BAB (Before → After → Bridge)
Best for: Onboarding, case studies, win-back emails

```
[Before] — Describe their current painful situation
[After]  — Paint the picture of life after the problem is solved
[Bridge] — Your product is how they get from before to after
```

Example:
```
Before: Every Monday you spend 3 hours pulling the same reports.
After:  Imagine opening your laptop and the report is already there.
Bridge: That's exactly what [product] does. Here's how to set it up.
```

---

### Formula 4: The "Star, Story, Solution" (SSS)
Best for: Longer nurture emails, newsletters

```
[Star]     — Introduce a relatable character (you, a customer, or the reader)
[Story]    — Tell their journey through the problem
[Solution] — Reveal how it was solved and how the reader can do the same
```

---

## Part 4 — The PS Line

The PS line is the second most-read part of any email after the subject line. Use it for:
- Your most important point (if they skim everything else)
- A secondary CTA (softer than the main one)
- A credibility boost (social proof, stat, testimonial)
- Urgency (deadline, scarcity)
- A human touch (makes automated emails feel personal)

## Part 6 — A/B Testing Email Elements

Always test one variable at a time. Priority order:

| Test Order | Element | Why |
|-----------|---------|-----|
| 1st | Subject line | Biggest impact on open rate |
| 2nd | Sender name | "John from Stripe" vs "Stripe" |
| 3rd | First line | Determines if they keep reading |
| 4th | CTA text | "Book a call" vs "See it live" vs "Start free" |
| 5th | Email length | Short vs medium vs long |
| 6th | Send time | Tuesday 10am vs Thursday 2pm |
| 7th | Plain text vs HTML | Personal vs branded |

### Minimum Sample Size for Valid Results
- Under 1,000 subscribers: don't A/B test yet — too noisy
- 1,000–5,000: test subject lines only
- 5,000+: test anything meaningfully

## Part 7 — Email Metrics Benchmarks

| Metric | Bad | Average | Good | Excellent |
|--------|-----|---------|------|-----------|
| Open Rate | <15% | 20–25% | 30–40% | 50%+ |
| Click Rate | <1% | 2–3% | 4–6% | 10%+ |
| Reply Rate (cold) | <1% | 2–4% | 5–8% | 10%+ |
| Unsubscribe Rate | >1% | 0.3–0.5% | <0.2% | <0.1% |
| Bounce Rate | >3% | 1–2% | <1% | <0.5% |

If your open rate is below 20% — the problem is your subject line or sender reputation, not your body copy.

If your click rate is below 2% — the problem is your CTA or body copy, not your subject line.

## Part 8 — The 5-Second Email Audit

Read your email in 5 seconds (like your reader will). You should be able to answer:

```
1. Who sent this?            → clear sender name
2. What do they want?        → clear purpose in first 2 lines
3. What's in it for me?      → benefit visible above the fold
4. What should I do?         → one obvious CTA
5. Why now?                  → urgency or relevance is clear
```

If any answer is "I'm not sure" — rewrite that part before sending.
