# Onboarding Email Templates (15)

## Email 1 — Welcome Email (Send immediately on signup)

**Subject:** welcome to {{product}} 👋

Hey {{name}},

You're in. Here's the one thing to do first:

👉 {{single most important action — e.g. "Connect your first integration"}}

That's it. Once you do that, everything else clicks into place.

If you hit any snag, just reply to this email — I read every one.

{{founder name}}
{{product}}

P.S. Most people who get the most out of {{product}} do {{action}} in the first 24 hours. You've got this.

✅ WHY IT WORKS:
- One action only (not a feature dump)
- Founder-signed = feels personal
- PS reinforces urgency without pressure
- Reply to this email = feels human

Hey {{name}},

Totally normal — most people get stuck at {{common friction point}}.

Here's a 2-min video that walks you through it: {{link}}

Or just reply and tell me where you got stuck — I'll help directly.

✅ WHY IT WORKS:
- "Did you get stuck?" is non-judgmental, opens dialogue
