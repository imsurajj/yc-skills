# 50+ Subject Line Formulas

## Rule of Thumb
- 40 characters or less for mobile (most email is opened on mobile)
- Never use ALL CAPS — feels like spam
- Use lowercase for cold/personal emails — feels more human
- 1 emoji max — and only if it matches your brand tone
- Never mislead — open rates mean nothing if trust is broken
