# Good Headlines (Annotated)

## Stripe
"Payment infrastructure for the internet."
✅ Why it works: Extremely specific audience (builders), not "payments made easy"

## Airbnb
"Belong anywhere."
✅ Why it works: Sells the emotional outcome, not the feature (renting rooms)

## Dropbox
"Keep life organized and work moving — all in one place."
✅ Why it works: Two pains solved (personal + professional), short, no jargon

## Brex
"The financial stack built for startups."
✅ Why it works: "Stack" signals B2B, "startups" narrows audience precisely

## Gusto
"A better way to run payroll, benefits, and HR."
✅ Why it works: "Better" frames competition without naming them

## Notion
"Your wiki, docs, and projects. Together."
✅ Why it works: Lists exact features, then unifies them with one word

## Linear
"The issue tracking tool you'll enjoy using."
