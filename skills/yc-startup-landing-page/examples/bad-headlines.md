# Bad Headlines (What to Avoid)

❌ "Leverage AI to supercharge your business workflows."
   Problem: Jargon ("leverage", "supercharge"), no specific audience, no outcome

❌ "We help companies grow faster with data-driven insights."
   Problem: Could describe any SaaS ever built. Zero differentiation.

❌ "The all-in-one platform for modern teams."
   Problem: "All-in-one" and "modern teams" are meaningless filler phrases

❌ "Revolutionizing the way people communicate."
   Problem: "Revolutionizing" is the most overused startup word ever

❌ "Empowering businesses to reach their full potential."
   Problem: No concrete outcome, no audience, pure corporate fluff

❌ "A smarter way to manage your workflow."
   Problem: "Smarter" and "workflow" together say nothing specific

## Common Patterns to Avoid

| Pattern | Example | Why Bad |
|---------|---------|---------|
| -izing words | "Revolutionizing payments" | Vague, overused |
| "All-in-one" | "All-in-one platform" | No differentiation |
| "Empower" | "Empower your team" | Means nothing |
| "Seamless" | "Seamless integration" | Expected, not a benefit |
| "Next-gen" | "Next-gen analytics" | What does gen mean here? |
| "AI-powered" alone | "AI-powered insights" | So what? What's the outcome? |
